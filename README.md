# Random-Password-Generator

Generates a random password from a list of prompts.

## **Description**

This application gives the user five prompts which include: the length of the password and whether or not to use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numberic characters, and special characters.

## **Modifications**

Variables were created first to establish the values for the given prompts. Next, a function was made to log the results of the prompts into an array. Once the array was created from the prompts, a new function was created to randomize these values into a password.

## **Credits**

On July 15th, I was tutored by John Titus who gave me insight on the number of steps needed for this application and encouraged me to go back through the mini project for hints on an approach to this project.
